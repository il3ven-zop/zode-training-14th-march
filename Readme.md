This repo was used to demo configuration and redis in Zode.

- `dotenv.js` - Demo for loading environment variables using dotenv.
- `transformedConfig.js` - Demo for how Zode internally uses dotenv to read configuration and transform it into an object.
- `portNumber.js` - Demo for changing port number
- `multipleEnv.js` - Demo for having different configurations for different environments.
- `redis.js` - Demo for using redis.
